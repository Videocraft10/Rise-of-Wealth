## Talking Points for Q&A

### Why Godot Engine?
"Godot is open-source, lightweight, and has excellent cross-platform support. Its scene-based architecture made it perfect for our modular career world design."

### How did you ensure no game-breaking bugs?
"We tested each challenge individually, then tested complete career paths. Each challenge is self-contained, reducing the chance of cascading errors. The modular design makes bugs easier to isolate and fix."

### What makes this educational?
"Each challenge authentically represents real-world scenarios from that profession. Players learn by doing - debugging actual code, making medical decisions, planning lessons, and managing budgets. The immediate feedback helps reinforce learning."

### How does it handle multiple outcomes?
"Each challenge has a scoring system (0-100). Players can make different choices leading to different scores. The final career score is the average of all three challenges, with performance feedback that varies based on the score achieved."

### What would you add next?
"We'd add more career paths, achievement systems, sound effects, animated visuals, and possibly multiplayer modes where teams can compare their career exploration progress."
